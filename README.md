# Chat SDK

Chat SDK is a free, open-source template built with Next.js and the AI SDK that helps you quickly build powerful chatbot applications.

This template ships with [xAI](https://x.ai) `grok-2-1212` as the default chat model. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

Install

    npm i -g vercel

# Recommended
- Use the Vercel Environment Variables for configuration.
